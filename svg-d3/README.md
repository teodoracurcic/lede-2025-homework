# Serbia: The Gap Between Wages and Needs

This is a D3.js assignment for the [Lede program](https://ledeprogram.com).

I created an SVG chart comparing Serbia’s minimum wage and average consumer basket in 2019 and 2024. Each value is represented as a square, scaled using `d3.scaleSqrt()`, and color-coded for clarity.

The goal was to replace the Bezos example with a relevant dataset and practice data binding, scaling, and basic styling in D3.

## Data

| Year | Wage ($) | Basket ($) |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 2019 | 259      | 675         |
| 2024 | 473      | 1049        |

## Next Steps

I’d like to add tooltips and make the chart responsive.
